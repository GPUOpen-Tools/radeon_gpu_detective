Radeon™ GPU Detective v1.6 Release Notes
========================================
Radeon™ GPU Detective (RGD) is a tool for post-mortem analysis of GPU crashes (TDRs).
Using the tool you can capture and analyze AMD GPU crash dumps and produce information that can help narrow down the search for the crash's root cause. 
Such information includes page fault details, resource details and execution markers reflecting the GPU work that was in progress at the moments leading to the crash

Highlights
==========
1. Added support for Hardware Crash Analysis on APUs (AMD Radeon™ 840M graphics, AMD Radeon™ 860M graphics, AMD Radeon™ 8040S Graphics, AMD Radeon™ 8050S Graphics and AMD Radeon™ 8060S Graphics).
2. SGPR and VGPR collection for all active waves at the time of the crash.
3. Shader Resource Descriptor (SRD) Analysis for offending memory instructions. For more information about Shader Resource Descriptor (SRD) Analysis, please refer to the RGD Documentation.
4. Fixed an issue in debug-info parsing where relative paths embedded in DXIL blobs were not handled correctly, which could prevent RGD from generating valid summary output.

Explicit exclusions
===================
- RGD targets GPU crashes (TDRs) on Windows®. RGD will not detect pure CPU crashes (for example, CPU null pointer dereference or integer division by zero). You will need to use a CPU debugger for that. Please use CPU debugging mechanisms to investigate such cases.
- Hardware Crash Analysis in RGD focuses on offending shaders. For this mode to be applicable to you crash case, the GPU crash needs to be triggered by a shader-executing hardware block. If the GPU crash happened somewhere else, no shader will be associated with the execution tree markers, and you will not have the benefits of the new Hardware Crash Analysis mode.

Known Issues
============
* Attempting to capture GPU crash dumps on a system with a Ryzen CPU that includes integrated graphics (with no connected discrete Radeon™ GPU) may result in a BSOD.
* In certain hang cases (where the GPU crash was not caused by a page fault), Hardware Crash Analysis may not detect the offending shader. However, as long as your crash case is supported by RGD, you can count on the "standard" (RGD v1.3) information to be included, whether or not the Hardware Crash Analysis feature was applicable to your crash case.
* When Hardware Crash Analysis feature is enabled on APUs with AMD Radeon™ 840M graphics or AMD Radeon™ 860M graphics, certain game or graphics app launch may result in a black screen.

System Requirements
===================
* Operating system: Windows 10 or 11.

* Latest Adrenalin Software driver. A system reboot is recommended after the driver installation. 

* GPU: Radeon™ RX 6000 series (RDNA™ 2), RX 7000 series (RDNA™ 3) or RX 9000 series (RDNA™ 4) card.

* Latest RDP (Radeon™ Developer Panel) version, which is available as part of the Radeon™ Developer Tool Suite and can be downloaded from GPUOpen.com. Make sure you are using RDP v3.4 or later.

Note that this version of RGD supports DirectX® 12 and Vulkan® applications, so you will need either DX12 or vulkan application that crashes. For the best experience, it is recommended to:
* Use string markers around render passes using the AMD GPU Services (AGS) library, as these will appear in the command line tool's output and will help identifying the code that was executing during the crash.
* Name resources such as heaps, buffers and textures using ID3D12Object::SetName() (for DX12 resources) and vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT() (for vulkan objects), as these names will appear in the Page Fault Summary section of the command line tool's output file, and are critical for identifying the offending resource when applicable.
