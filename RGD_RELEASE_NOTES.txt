Radeon™ GPU Detective v1.2 Release Notes
=======================================
Radeon GPU Detective (RGD) is a tool for post-mortem analysis of GPU crashes (TDRs).
Using the tool you can capture and analyze AMD GPU crash dumps and produce information that can help narrow down the search for the crash's root cause. 
Such information includes page fault details, resource details and execution markers reflecting the GPU work that was in progress at the moments leading to the crash

Highlights
==========
This release improves the default execution markers which are baked into the AMD drivers and provide additional information even without inserting user markers. Examples of the information added:

* Index, vertex and instance counts for draw calls
* Thread group count for compute dispatches
* Improved default raytracing and mesh shader markers
* Barriers
* Queue type (Direct for graphics, Compute for compute)

Example output (with a single "Frame 429" user marker):

Command Buffer ID: 0x883 (Queue type: Direct)
=============================================
[>] "Frame 429"
 ├─[X] Draw(VertextCount=3, InstanceCount=1)
 ├─[X] ----------Barrier---------- 
 └─[>] Dispatch(ThreadGroupCount=[16,16,1])

Explicit exclusions
===================
- RGD targets GPU crashes (TDRs) on Windows®. RGD will not detect pure CPU crashes (for example, CPU null pointer dereference or integer division by zero). You will need to use a CPU debugger for that. Please use CPU debugging mechanisms to investigate such cases.

Known Issues
============
* When performing back-to-back crash analysis sessions of Vulkan applications on RDNA™2 GPUs (Radeon RX 6000 series) using RDP, you may run into a situation where the crash dump file generated is invalid. RDP will show an error
    message saying: "Summary generation failed” and clicking on "Show error" will display a text description that ends with "execution marker information missing [UMD]". As a workaround, restart RDP. A fix for this issue will be
	included in an upcoming driver update - there is no need to update the tool.
* In certain cases, trying to capture a GPU crash dump of an app that has Microsoft® DRED enabled can lead to a system crash.
* In Radeon Developer Panel (RDP), it may happen that generated .rgd crash dump files appear with a wrong file size of 0 bytes.
* Attempting to capture GPU crash dumps on a system with a Ryzen CPU that includes integrated graphics (with no connected discrete Radeon GPU) may result in a BSOD.
* A system reboot is recommended after the driver installation. An invalid crash dump file may get generated when RGD workflow is executed after a fresh driver installation without a system reboot.

System Requirements
===================
* Operating system: Windows 10 or 11.

* Latest Adrenalin Software driver (minimum version 23.12.1).

* GPU: Radeon™ RX 6000 series (RDNA™2) or RX 7000 series (RDNA™3) card.

* Latest RDP (Radeon Developer Panel) version, which is available as part of the Radeon Developer Tool Suite and can be downloaded from GPUOpen.com. Make sure you are using RDP v2.12.0.7 or later.

Note that this version of RGD supports DirectX® 12 and Vulkan® applications, so you will need either DX12 or vulkan application that crashes. For the best experience, it is recommended to:
* Use string markers around render passes using the AMD GPU Services (AGS) library, as these will appear in the command line tool's output and will help identifying the code that was executing during the crash.
* Name resources such as heaps, buffers and textures using ID3D12Object::SetName() (for DX12 resources) and vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT() (for vulkan objects), as these names will appear in the Page Fault Summary section of the command line tool's output file, and are critical for identifying the offending resource when applicable.
